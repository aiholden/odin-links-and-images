    <!--Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. -->
    <!--Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.-->
    <!--Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.-->

        The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded.-->
